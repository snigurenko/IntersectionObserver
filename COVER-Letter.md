# Hi, here I want to note some information about the task.

1. Use vs Code and Live Server plugin to run the project 
2. I also use Live Sass Compiler plugin for vs code

* At index.html I just add script tag and link to css

# what was done using Intersection Observer:
1. Titles h1 h2 h3 makes red and move
2. such elements (and their content) as p, ul, table change color
